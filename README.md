A fast and efficient autocomplete engine built using **Trie** and **frequency-based ranking** in C++.  
Type a prefix and get top suggestions instantly â€” just like Google or your keyboard!

## Features
- Prefix search with top 5 suggestions
- Frequency-based ranking
- Built using Trie (Prefix Tree)
- Time complexity: O(L), where L = length of prefix

- Store logs of user queries and suggestions  
- Implement fuzzy matching for typos  
- Create a web or GUI interface using React or SFML
